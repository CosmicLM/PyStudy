#machine language is binary code, so, either 0 or 1. so
#in order for a computer to run any code, it will translate it somehow to 
#binary data.

#Binary Alphabet

#Compiled languages are programming languages that can only be
#used passing by a middleman (the compiler) to get to the computer
#these languages are very fast because the instructions are precompiled to passed to the machine.

#Some examples are Cobol, C, C++, Go, Rust


#Interpreted languages are programming languages which instructions are precompiled for computers to read.
#because of this, interpreted languages are usually slower, because it uses an interpreter as the middle man 

#Interpreted Clanguages are: Python, Java, PHP
