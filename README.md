# My Python Learning Journey

> A repository to document my progress and projects while mastering the fundamentals of Python, following a structured 15-section curriculum.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is my personal workspace for learning Python from the ground up. It follows a structured, project-based curriculum designed to build a practical and solid understanding of the language.

Each directory corresponds to a section of the curriculum and will contain:
* `topics.py`: A file with code examples illustrating the core concepts of that section.
* `project_*.py`: A script for the section's "Bonus Project" to apply and test my knowledge.

## 📊 Current Status

**Status:** 🚀 In Progress
**Current Section:** Section 1: The Absolute Basics

## 📁 Repository Structure

I will organize the repository with a dedicated folder for each section to keep the code and projects clean and easy to find.

## 🎯 My Goals

* **Complete** all 15 sections and their corresponding bonus projects.
* **Understand** not just *how* to write the code, but *why* it works.
* **Build** a portfolio of small, useful, and functional CLI scripts.
* **Develop** a strong habit of reading tracebacks and debugging my own code.
